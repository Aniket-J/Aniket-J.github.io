<p>Iâ€™m a PhD Researcher with The Open University and a Visiting Researcher (and former Research Assistant) with Imperial College London. Currently, Iâ€™m looking for opportunities in machine learning.</p>

<p>My PhD focusses on combining high temperature steel performance with machine learning while my RA-ship, funded by the HSE, analysed the dispersion of COVID-19 under the umbrella of the National Core Study (NCS) project.</p>

<p>My PhD deals with high-temperature performance of materials and how they perform over a long period of time (40 years+) due to creep.
Broadly, this can be divided into 3 phases:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Experimentation</li>
  <li>Simulation</li>
  <li>Machine learning</li>
</ul>

<p>The experiments involved are a departure from the conventionally used sub-size specimens in the industry. My research adopts miniaturized novel specimen geometries for these tests. Volumetrically, one of my test‚Äôs samples is around 80 times smaller than its conventional counterparts. Picture below to illustrate the size of the specimen compared to my index finger!</p>

<p>My research would make it easier to inspect powerplants and jet-engines with minimal amount of material, thereby not impacting the structural integrity either. This would help in the development of new alloys and test irradiated structures with even more safety.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve gone one step further in my research and I‚Äôm investigating the feasibility of combining 3 tests from a single specimen. Volumetrically this would result in an 85x smaller specimen overall. Combing 3 tests (creep, tensile, fatigue) is also groundbreaking for these industries. My research overview is outlined below.</p>

<p>In addition to this, I am also responsible for maintaining the department‚Äôs proprietary software (written in MATLAB) for Digital Image Correlation</p>

<p>As part of the NCS (National COVID-19 Study) Project, I work as a Research Assistant within the AMCG (Applied Modelling &amp; Computation Group) at Imperial College London.</p>

<p>My work involves analyzing the propagation of air-flows in different built environments. My work goes on to inform policymaking for COVID-19 and how mitigating measures may be implemented for better health and safety of occupants in any given structure.</p>

<p>This work involves numerical simulations on <a href="https://multifluids.github.io/">IC-FERST</a>, of which I am a developer, for large-scale geometries/structures that are also designed with the help of an in-house software.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, due to the confidential nature of this work, I am not able share any cool images relating to this.</p>

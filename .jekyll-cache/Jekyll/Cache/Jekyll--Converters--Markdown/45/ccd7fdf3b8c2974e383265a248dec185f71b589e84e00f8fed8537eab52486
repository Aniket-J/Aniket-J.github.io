I"Ò<p>I enjoy a lot of things in my downtime. Apart from the things Iâ€™ve listed below, I also enjoy instant film photography (using an Instax Mini 90) and adventure sports. The latter mainly involves jumping (safely) from high places, but Iâ€™m keen on exploring watersports next!</p>
<h1 id="climbing">Climbing</h1>

<p>I use bouldering as a way to better my mental health.</p>

<p>I havenâ€™t been doing it for long, though. I started in June 2021 but I was set back by a slip that ruined my ankle. Still recovering from it, but I tend to climb with much more precision now because of this!</p>

<p>Currently climbing V3s. See attached picture below for one of my current projects.</p>

<p>Climbing is a major part of my life now and I use it as a way to organize my thoughts and go to a zen place. Itâ€™s truly magical and discovering this sport has been a life-changing experience for me.</p>

<h1 id="coffee">Coffee</h1>

<p>As someone who grew in a caffeine-free household, I never thought that coffee would become a subject of passion for me. All I ever drank, prior to this journey, was instant coffee mixed with copious amounts of sugar.</p>

<p>However, during the first Christmas lockdown, thanks to an online offer, I discovered the joy of coffee. I discovered the amazing tasting notes it could possess. Ever since then, this has spiralled into a journey of exploration and discovery about coffee. It has also meant that I can make fresh Affogato at home! See pic below.</p>

<p>Ever since then, I have been on a whirlwind journey of sampling different coffees and acquiring different brewers. My current favourite is the <a href="https://www.aprilcoffeeroasters.com/pages/april-pour-over">April brewer</a>. It produces obscenely good coffee with my <a href="https://www.wilfa.co.uk/product/kitchen/uniform-coffee-grinder/">Wilfa Uniform</a>! Current coffee kit displayed below. Itâ€™s not much, but Iâ€™m just getting started. My espresso machine is a modified Delonghi Dedica EC685, but it isnâ€™t producing the cup quality that I want. Eyeing the Rancilio Silvia for a future upgrade!</p>

<h1 id="cooking">Cooking</h1>

<p>Cooking is another thing that I use as a tool to de-stress myself. My name literally translates to a <em>nomad</em>, and I do feel that way all the time, but this is one of the few things that connects me to a metaphorical home.</p>

<p>I mainly cook dishes from the Indian subcontinent, but, when I have the time, I love experimenting with dishes! Due to my perfectionist nature, I tend to obsess over details even in cooking. This has resulted in me perfecting two recipes that Iâ€™m proud of: Chole/Chickpea Masala (picture below) and Paneer Bhurji (scramble). I cooked these for my family when I visited them and they had to conceeded it was better than mumâ€™s!</p>

  <li>PhD Researcher, The Open University <strong>(current)</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>My PhD deals with High Temperature Steels and how they perform over a long period of time (40 years+).</p>

<p>Broadly, this can be divided into 3 phases:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Experimentation</li>
  <li>Simulation</li>
  <li>Machine learning</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="fun-stuff">Fun stuff</h1>

<p>Currently, I’m working on the following things. These are just things that I like to do in my free time.</p>

<ol>
  <li>BMW-esque volume control for Linux</li>
</ol>

<p>This fun project uses OpenCV to recognize my hands and track its movements to control the volume of my PC. I found this really nifty and wanted to see if I could implement BMW’s gesture control system’s gestures for Linux. It’s still a work in progress and I need to do a small GUI for it before I can make this open-source.</p>

<p>The source-code for it is here.</p>

<ol>
  <li>GUI for Open University’s proprietary code</li>
</ol>

<p>Where am I going with this basically</p>

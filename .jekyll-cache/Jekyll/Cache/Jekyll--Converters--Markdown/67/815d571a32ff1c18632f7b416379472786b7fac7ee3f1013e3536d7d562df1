<p>My PhD deals with high-temperature performance of materials and how they perform over a long period of time (40 years+) due to creep.
Broadly, this can be divided into 3 phases:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Experimentation</li>
  <li>Simulation</li>
  <li>Machine learning</li>
</ul>

<p>The experiments involved are a departure from the conventionally used sub-size specimens in the industry. My research adopts miniaturized novel specimen geometries for these tests. Volumetrically, one of my testâ€™s samples is around 80 times smaller than its conventional counterparts. Picture below to illustrate the size of the specimen compared to my index finger!</p>

<p>My research would make it easier to inspect powerplants and jet-engines with minimal amount of material, thereby not impacting the structural integrity either. This would help in the development of new alloys and test irradiated structures with even more safety.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve gone one step further in my research and Iâ€™m investigating the feasibility of combining 3 tests from a single specimen. Volumetrically this would result in an 85x smaller specimen overall. Combing 3 tests (creep, tensile, fatigue) is also groundbreaking for these industries. My research overview is outlined below.</p>

<p>In addition to this, I am also responsible for maintaining the departmentâ€™s proprietary software (written in MATLAB) for Digital Image Correlation</p>

<p>As part of the NCS (National COVID-19 Study) Project, I work as a Research Assistant within the AMCG (Applied Modelling &amp; Computation Group) at Imperial College London.</p>

<p>My work involves analyzing the propagation of air-flows in different built environments. My work goes on to inform policymaking for COVID-19 and how mitigating measures may be implemented for better health and safety of occupants in any given structure.</p>

<p>This work involves numerical simulations on <a href="https://multifluids.github.io/">IC-FERST</a>, of which I am a developer,</p>

<p>Unfortunately, due to the confidential nature of this work, I am not able share any cool images relating to this.</p>

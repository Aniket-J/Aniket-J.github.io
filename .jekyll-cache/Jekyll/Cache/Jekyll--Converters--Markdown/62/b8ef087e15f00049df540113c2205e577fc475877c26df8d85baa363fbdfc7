<p>My PhD deals with high-temperature performance of materials and how they perform over a long period of time (40 years+) due to creep.
Broadly, this can be divided into 3 phases:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Experimentation</li>
  <li>Simulation</li>
  <li>Machine learning</li>
</ul>

<p>The experiments involved are a departure from the conventionally used sub-size specimens in the industry. My research adopts miniaturized novel specimen geometries for these tests. Volumetrically, my specimens save xyz%

<h1 id="fun-stuff">Fun stuff</h1>

<p>Currently, I’m working on the following things. These are just things that I like to do in my free time.</p>

<ol>
  <li>BMW-esque volume control for Linux</li>
</ol>

<p>This fun project uses OpenCV to recognize my hands and track its movements to control the volume of my PC. I found this really nifty and wanted to see if I could implement BMW’s gesture control system’s gestures for Linux. It’s still a work in progress and I need to do a small GUI for it before I can make this open-source.</p>

<p>The source-code for it is here.</p>

<ol>
  <li>GUI for Open University’s proprietary code</li>
</ol>

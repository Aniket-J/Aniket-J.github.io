<p>I use bouldering as a way to better my mental health. I haven’t been doing it for long, though. I started in June 2021 but I was set back by a slip that ruined my ankle. Still recovering from it, but I tend to climb with much more precision now because of this!</p>

<p>Ever since then, I have been on a whirlwind journey</p>

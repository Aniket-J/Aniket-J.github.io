I"C<p>Hello! I’m Aniket and welcome to my personal website.</p>

<p>I’m a PhD Researcher with The Open University and a former Research Assistant with Imperial College London, where I completed my MSc in Advanced Nuclear Engineering with Distinction and won the William Penney prize for my thesis.</p>

<p>Currently, I’m looking for opportunities that leverage innovative approaches to solve challenging problems in data science and machine learning.</p>

<p>My PhD focuses on combining high temperature steel performance with machine learning while my RA-ship, funded by the HSE, analyzed the dispersion of COVID-19 under the umbrella of the National Transmission Project (NTP).</p>

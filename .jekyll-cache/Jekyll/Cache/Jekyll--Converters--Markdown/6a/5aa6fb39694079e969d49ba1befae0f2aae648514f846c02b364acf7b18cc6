<p>I have a broad skillset that I have enhanced over the years. My current focus is on data-driven solutions for complex systems. I‚Äôm especially interested in roles that aim to combine machine learning with rigorous scientific avenues. Even better if it involves a bit of Material Science!</p>

<p>My diverse set of experiences would make me a valuable addition to any team, and I would prove to be an asset with my quick learning abilities. I have also led collaborative multinational studies and worked on a breadth of physical computation domains.</p>

<p>My PhD deals with high-temperature performance of materials and how they perform at a small-scale.</p>

<p>Broadly, this can be divided into 3 phases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Experimentation</li>
  <li>Simulation</li>
  <li>Machine learning</li>
</ul>

<p>The experiments involved were a departure from the conventionally used big specimens in the industry. My research adopts miniaturized novel specimen geometries for these tests. Volumetrically, my newly designed test technique provides a materials saving of 97.89%.</p>

<p>My research would make it easier to inspect powerplants and jet-engines with minimal amount of material, therefore not impacting the structural integrity. This would help in the development of new alloys and test irradiated structures with a higher safety margin.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve gone one step further in my research and I‚Äôm investigating the feasibility of combining 3 tests from a single specimen (Small Punch + Small Ring Test). Volumetrically, this resulted in materials savings of 97.89%. Combing 3 tests (creep, tensile, fatigue) is also groundbreaking for these industries. My research overview is outlined below.</p>

<p>This combination can be visualized in the image below, with the ring painted for computer-vision based strain imaging.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">Visualizing my hypothesis of combining ring and disc testing.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I used optimization routines in conjunction with numerical simulations to obtain unknown material parameters. I leveraged this technique to translate the test‚Äôs force-displacement data to a more general-purpose stress-strain data for this new testing methodology.</p>

<p>This data was then fed into regression models (XGBoost and Random Forests, primarily) to analyse rate-dependency of the test. The models trained well with an R2 score of 0.95632 and the predictions were extremely close on new hidden data as well, as seen in the image below.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">Predictions on new experiments.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>My original experiments also performed largely well, as you can see in the heatmaps below. For the Small Ring Test (SRT) I performed 48 experiments at different pin displacement rates and for the Small Punch Test (SPT) I analysed the discs separately and both sets of inter-test comparison results are shown below:</p>

<p>Extensive data cleaning procedures were also analysed, such as butterworth signal filtering (shown below) or the convolution smoothing. See the image below! I also devised a data-cleaning GUI-app for the department so that people don‚Äôt have to go through the faff of creating this from scratch for their experiments. <a href="https://github.com/Aniket-J/MatSci-DC/tree/main">GitHub repo here</a></p>

<p>Using the power of physics baked in with my analytical solution, I devised a physics-informed data-driven conversion method that allows users to obtain material parameteres directly without the need of any expensive simulations for the Small Ring Test.</p>

<p>Below are a couple of images of the Small Ring Test as well. Images are taken from a Nikon D850 camera.</p>

<h5 id="research-assistant-imperial-college-london-ncs---protect-april-2021---march-2022">Research Assistant, Imperial College London (NCS - PROTECT) <strong>(April 2021 - March 2022)</strong></h5>

<p>As part of the National Transmission Project (NTP), PROTECT portfolio, I worked as a Research Assistant within the AMCG (Applied Modelling &amp; Computation Group) at Imperial College London.</p>

<p>My work involved analyzing the propagation of air-flows in different built environments. My work went on to inform the knowledge domain for COVID-19 and how mitigating measures may be implemented for better health and safety of occupants in any given structure.</p>

<p>This work involves numerical simulations on <a href="https://multifluids.github.io/">IC-FERST</a> for large-scale geometries/structures that are also designed with the help of an in-house software.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, due to the confidential nature of this work, I am not able share any cool images relating to this.</p>

<h5 id="visiting-researcher-imperial-college-london-october-2019---september-2022">Visiting Researcher, Imperial College London <strong>(October 2019 - September 2022)</strong></h5>

<p>This role pertained largely to research in severe accidents in nuclear reactors, and was a part of an ongoing effort to establish international cooperation between AMCG and other academic partners. We published a hugely collaborative paper (titled <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnucene.2022.104555">‚ÄòNumerical Study of the Effect of Geometry on the Behaviour of Internally Heated Melt Pools for In-Vessel Melt Retention‚Äô</a>).</p>

<p>In this role, I supervised MSc projects with our partners and enhance IC-FERST‚Äôs capabilities (in-house numerical simulation software) for better simulating severe accidents.</p>

<p>The severe accidents pertain to a cataclysmic event in the lower-head of a reactor pressure vessel, where all the fuel material collects post-accident. More specifically, this work involves simulating the cooling of this fuel debris (it emits a lot of residual heat) and analyze its safety. Below is a snapshot of the fluid dynamics in this reactor after 8 seconds of simulation.</p>

<h5 id="project-intern-drdo-india-dec-2017---may-2018">Project Intern, DRDO, India <strong>(Dec 2017 - May 2018)</strong></h5>

<p>This role involved performing a lot of finite element analysis (FEA), especially in the domain of shock physics and shock loading. Coming into this role, I had virtually zero knowledge about these domains.</p>

<p>However, I was soon simulating shock physics and structural interactions for the design of shock-resistant structures in my role.</p>

<p>I was also leading a study that analysed the effect of variation of geometry in cylindrical charges. This was in addition to other numerous activities, such as analyzing foam attenuation and soil attenuation, that I contributed to.</p>

<p>My role was brief but extremely intensive and I successfully delivered on numerous projects.</p>

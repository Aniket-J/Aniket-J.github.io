<p>I have a broad skillset that I have enhanced over the years. My current focus is on data-driven solutions for complex systems. I’m especially interested in roles that aim to combine machine learning with rigorous scientific avenues. Even better if it involves a bit of Material Science!</p>

<p>My diverse set of experiences would make me a valuable addition to any team, and I would prove to be an asset with my quick learning abilities. I have also led collaborative multinational studies and worked on a breadth of physical computation domains.</p>

<p>My PhD deals with high-temperature performance of materials and how they perform at a small-scale.</p>

<p>Broadly, this can be divided into 3 phases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Experimentation</li>
  <li>Simulation</li>
  <li>Machine learning</li>
</ul>

<p>The experiments involved are a departure from the conventionally used big specimens in the industry. My research adopts miniaturized novel specimen geometries for these tests. Volumetrically, my newly designed test technique provides a materials saving of 97.89%.</p>

<p>My research would make it easier to inspect powerplants and jet-engines with minimal amount of material, therefore not impacting the structural integrity. This would help in the development of new alloys and test irradiated structures with a higher safety margin.</p>

<p>I’ve gone one step further in my research and I’m investigating the feasibility of combining 3 tests from a single specimen (Small Punch + Small Ring Test). Volumetrically this would result in an 85x smaller specimen overall. Combing 3 tests (creep, tensile, fatigue) is also groundbreaking for these industries. My research overview is outlined below.</p>

<p>I have used optimization routines in conjunction with numerical simulations to obtain unknown material parameters. I leveraged this technique to translate the test’s force-displacement data to a more general-purpose stress-strain data for this new testing methodology.</p>

<p>This data was then fed into regression models (XGBoost and Random Forests, primarily) to analyse rate-dependency of the test. The models trained well with an R2 score of 0.95632.</p>

<p>Using the power of physics baked in with my analytical solution, I devised a physics-informed data-driven conversion method that allows users to obtain material parameteres directly without the need of any expensive simulations.</p>

<p>Below are a couple of images of the Small Ring Test as well. Images are taken from a Nikon D850 camera.</p>

<p>As part of the National Transmission Project (NTP), PROTECT portfolio, I worked as a Research Assistant within the AMCG (Applied Modelling &amp; Computation Group) at Imperial College London.</p>

<p>My work involved analyzing the propagation of air-flows in different built environments. My work went on to inform policymaking for COVID-19 and how mitigating measures may be implemented for better health and safety of occupants in any given structure.</p>

<p>This work involves numerical simulations on <a href="https://multifluids.github.io/">IC-FERST</a>, of which I am a developer, for large-scale geometries/structures that are also designed with the help of an in-house software.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, due to the confidential nature of this work, I am not able share any cool images relating to this.</p>

<h5 id="visiting-researcher-imperial-college-london-current">Visiting Researcher, Imperial College London <strong>(current)</strong></h5>

<p>This role pertains largely to research in severe accidents in nuclear reactors, and is an ongoing effort to establish international cooperation between AMCG and other academic partners. We currently have a huge collaborative paper (titled ‘Numerical Study of the Effect of Geometry on the Behaviour of Internally Heated Melt Pools for In-Vessel Melt Retention’) under review.</p>

<p>In this role, I supervise MSc projects with our partners and enhance IC-FERST’s capabilities (in-house numerical simulation software) for better simulating severe accidents. The projects aim to combine CFD with machine learning to augment the analyses.</p>

<p>The severe accidents pertain to a cataclysmic event in the lower-head of a reactor pressure vessel, where all the fuel material collects post-accident. More specifically, this work involves simulating the cooling of this fuel debris (it emits a lot of residual heat) and analyze its safety. Below is a snapshot of the fluid dynamics in this reactor after 8 seconds of simulation.</p>

<p>This role involved performing a lot of finite element analysis (FEA), especially in the domain of shock physics and shock loading. Coming into this role, I had virtually zero knowledge about these domains.</p>

<p>However, I was soon simulating shock physics and structural interactions for the design of shock-resistant structures in my role.</p>

<p>I was also leading a study that analysed the effect of variation of geometry in cylindrical charges. This was in addition to other numerous activities, such as analyzing foam attenuation and soil attenuation, that I contributed to.</p>

<p>My role was brief but extremely intensive and I successfully delivered on numerous projects.</p>

<p>I use bouldering as a way to better my mental health.</p>

<p>I haven’t been doing it for long, though. I started in June 2021 but I was set back by a slip that ruined my ankle. Still recovering from it, but I tend to climb with much more precision now because of this!</p>

<p>Currently climbing V3s. See attached picture below for one of my projects.</p>

<p>Climbing is a major part of my life now and I use it as a way to organize my thoughts and go to a zen place. It’s truly magical and discovering this sport has been a life-changing experience for me.</p>

<h1 id="coffee">Coffee</h1>

<p>As someone who grew in a caffeine-free household, I never thought that coffee would become a subject of passion for me. All I drank back home was instant coffee mixed with copious amounts of sugar.</p>

<p>However, during the first Christmas lockdown, thanks to an online offer, I discovered the joy of coffee. I discovered the amazing tasting notes it could possess. Ever since then, this has spiralled into a journey of exploration and discovery about coffee. It has also meant that I can make fresh Affogato’s at home! See pic below.</p>

<p>Ever since then, I have been on a whirlwind journey of sampling different coffees and acquiring different brewers. My current favourite is the April brewer. It produces obscenely good coffee with my Wilfa Uniform! Current coffee kit displayed below. Any upgrade recommendations?</p>

<p>My espresso machine is a modified Delonghi Dedica EC685, but it isn’t producing the cup quality that I want. Eyeing the Rancilio Silvia for a future upgrade!</p>
<h1 id="adventure">Adventure</h1>

<p>I have a prediliction for adventure sports (when I can afford them), especially those that involve heights. I do have deep sea diving on my radar but I am yet to give it a go. I’m especially excited about that since I’m terrified of water!</p>

<p>I find it hard to describe why jumping from high places gives me a tranquil rush.</p>

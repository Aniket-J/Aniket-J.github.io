# Research & work experience

##### PhD Researcher, The Open University **(current)** #####
My PhD deals with high-temperature performance of materials and how they perform over a long period of time (40 years+) due to creep.
Broadly, this can be divided into 3 phases:
* Experimentation
* Simulation
* Machine learning

The experiments involved are a departure from the conventionally used sub-size specimens in the industry. My research adopts miniaturized novel specimen geometries for these tests. Volumetrically, one of my test's samples is around 80 times smaller than its conventional counterparts. Picture below to illustrate the size of the specimen compared to my index finger!

My research would make it easier to inspect powerplants and jet-engines with minimal amount of material, thereby not impacting the structural integrity either. This would help in the development of new alloys and test irradiated structures with even more safety.

I've gone one step further in my research and I'm investigating the feasibility of combining 3 tests from a single specimen. Volumetrically this would result in an 85x smaller specimen overall. Combing 3 tests (creep, tensile, fatigue) is also groundbreaking for these industries. My research overview is outlined below.

In addition to this, I am also responsible for maintaining the department's proprietary software (written in MATLAB) for Digital Image Correlation
##### Research Assistant, Imperial College London (NCS Project) **(current)** #####

As part of the NCS (National COVID-19 Study) Project, I work as a Research Assistant within the AMCG (Applied Modelling & Computation Group) at Imperial College London. 

My work involves analyzing the propagation of air-flows in different built environments. My work goes on to inform policymaking for COVID-19 and how mitigating measures may be implemented for better health and safety of occupants in any given structure. 

This work involves numerical simulations on [IC-FERST](https://multifluids.github.io/), of which I am a developer, for large-scale geometries/structures that are also designed with the help of an in-house software.

Unfortunately, due to the confidential nature of this work, I am not able share any cool images relating to this. 

##### Visiting Researcher, Imperial College London **(current)** #####

This role pertains largely to research in severe accidents in nuclear reactors, and is an ongoing effort to establish international cooperation between AMCG and other academic partners.

In this role, I supervise MSc projects with our partners and enhance IC-FERST's capabilities (in-house numerical simulation software) for better simulating severe accidents. The projects aim to combine CFD with machine learning to augment the analyses.

The severe accidents pertain to a cataclysmic event in the lower-head of a reactor pressure vessel, where all the fuel material collects post-accident. More specifically, this work involves simulating the cooling of this fuel debris (it emits a lot of residual heat) and analyze its safety. Below is a snapshot of the fluid dynamics in this reactor after 8 seconds of simulation.

##### Project Intern, DRDO, India **(Dec 2017 - May 2018)** #####

This role involved performing a lot of finite element analysis (FEA), especially in the domain of shock physics and shock loading. Coming into this role, I had virtually zero knowledge about these domains.

However, I was soon simulating shock physics and structural interactions for the design of shock-resistant structures in my role. 

I was also leading a study that analysed the effect of variation of geometry in cylindrical charges. This was in addition to other numerous activities, such as analyzing foam attenuation and soil attenuation, that I contributed to.

My role was brief but extremely intensive and I successfully delivered on numerous projects. References available upon request!

# What I bring to the table

I have a broad skillset that I have enhanced over the years. My current focus is machine learning and its applicability in the real world. I'm especially interested in roles that aim to combine MLOps with rigorous scientific avenues. Even better if it involves a bit of Material Science!

My diverse set of experiences would make me a valuable addition to any team, and I would prove to be an asset with my quick learning abilities.

# Research & work experience

1. PhD Researcher, The Open University **(current)**

My PhD deals with high-temperature performance materials and how they perform over a long period of time (40 years+) due to creep.

Broadly, this can be divided into 3 phases:
* Experimentation
* Simulation
* Machine learning

The experiments involved are a departure from the conventionally used sub-size specimens in the industry. My research adopts miniaturized novel specimen geometries for these tests. Volumetrically, my specimens save xyz%

2. Research Assistant, Imperial College London (NCS Project) **(current)**

As part of the NCS (National COVID-19 Study) Project, I work as a Research Assistant within the AMCG (Applied Modelling & Computation Group) at Imperial College London.

# Fun stuff

Currently, I'm working on the following things. These are just things that I like to do in my free time.

1. BMW-esque volume control for Linux

This fun project uses OpenCV to recognize my hands and track its movements to control the volume of my PC. I found this really nifty and wanted to see if I could implement BMW's gesture control system's gestures for Linux. It's still a work in progress and I need to do a small GUI for it before I can make this open-source.

The source-code for it is here. 

2. GUI for Open University's proprietary code

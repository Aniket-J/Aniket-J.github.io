# Climbing

I use bouldering as a way to better my mental health. I haven't been doing it for long, though. I started in June 2021 but I was set back by a slip that ruined my ankle. Still recovering from it, but I tend to climb with much more precision now because of this!

[Here's a link to my Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/climbing_aniketj/) where I upload almost weekly. Feel free to have a look!

# Coffee

As someone who grew in a caffeine free household, I never thought that coffee would become a subject of passion for me. All I drank back home was instant coffee mixed with copious amounts of sugar.

However, during the first Christmas lockdown, thanks to an online offer, I discovered the joy of coffee. I discovered the amazing tasting notes it could possess. Ever since then, this has spiralled into a journey of exploration and discovery about coffee. 

Ever since then, I have been on a whirlwind journey of sampling different coffees and acquiring different brewers. My current favourite is the April brewer. It produces obscenely good coffee with my Wilfa Uniform!

My espresso machine is a modified Dedica EC685, but it isn't producing the cup quality that I want. Eyeing the Rancilio Silvia for a future upgrade!

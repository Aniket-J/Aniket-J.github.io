I enjoy a lot of things in my downtime. Apart from the things I've listed below, I also enjoy instant film photography (using an Instax Mini 90) and adventure sports. The latter mainly involves jumping (safely) from high places, but I'm keen on exploring watersports next!

# Aerials

Aerialist for around a year now.

Been trying my hand at Aerial Slings and Straps in Southwark lately and the progress over the past few months has been insanely rewarding to see. Something I'll probably stick to for a long, long time.

Very rewarding for strength and flexibility training. Do recommend it!

# Climbing

I use bouldering as a way to better my mental health. 

I haven't been doing it for long, though. I started in June 2021 but I was set back by a slip that ruined my ankle. Still recovering from it, but I tend to climb with much more precision now because of this!

# Coffee

As someone who grew up in a caffeine-free household, I never thought that coffee would become a subject of passion for me. All I ever drank, prior to this journey, was instant coffee mixed with copious amounts of sugar.

However, during the first Christmas lockdown, thanks to an online offer, I discovered the joy of coffee. I discovered the amazing tasting notes it could possess. Ever since then, this has spiralled into a journey of exploration and discovery about coffee. It has also meant that I can make fresh Affogato at home! See pic below.

Ever since then, I have been on a whirlwind journey of sampling different coffees and acquiring different brewers. My current favourite is the [April brewer](https://www.aprilcoffeeroasters.com/pages/april-pour-over). It produces obscenely good coffee with my [Wilfa Uniform](https://www.wilfa.co.uk/product/kitchen/uniform-coffee-grinder/)! Current coffee kit displayed below. It's not much, but I'm just getting started. My espresso machine is a modified Delonghi Dedica EC685, but it isn't producing the cup quality that I want. Eyeing the Rancilio Silvia for a future upgrade!

# Cooking

Cooking is another thing that I use as a tool to de-stress myself. My name literally translates to a *nomad*, and I do feel that way all the time, but this is one of the few things that connects me to a metaphorical home.

I mainly cook dishes from the Indian subcontinent, but, when I have the time, I love experimenting with dishes! Due to my perfectionist nature, I tend to obsess over details even in cooking. This has resulted in me perfecting two recipes that I'm proud of: Chole/Chickpea Masala (picture below) and Paneer Bhurji (scramble). I cooked these for my family when I visited them and they had to conceeded it was better than mum's!

Hello! I'm Aniket and welcome to my personal website. 

Currently a Gen AI Research Engineer with the Royal College of Art (RCA) and the Young Vic Theatre. Very exciting role. Exploring and deploying tons of Gen AI tech, that includes LLMs, speech, and images. Very rewarding to see stuff in deployment, as I did the alpha run of the whole system as well recently. 

Do have a PhD as well. My PhD focussed on combining high temperature steel performance with machine learning. Also did MLOps with [Pzeros](https://pzeros.com/), where I created and managed the computer vision pipelines (Docker mainly, deployed serverless (Cloud Run) and stateful (kubernetes)) and also the Looker (dashboard) side of things for visualisation.

Also a former Research Assistant with Imperial College London (where I completed my MSc in Advanced Nuclear Engineering with Distinction and won the William Penney prize for my thesis), funded by the HSE, analysed the dispersion of COVID-19 under the umbrella of the National Core Studies (NCS).

Head over to the tabs in the navigation bar to find out more about me.

Thank you so much for visiting. I hope you have a great day!

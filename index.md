Hello! I'm Aniket and welcome to my personal website. 

I'm a PhD Researcher with The Open University and a former Research Assistant with Imperial College London, where I completed my MSc in Advanced Nuclear Engineering with Distinction and won the William Penney prize for my thesis. 

Currently, I'm looking for opportunities that leverage innovative approaches to solve challenging problems in data science and machine learning.

My PhD focussed on combining high temperature steel performance with machine learning while my RA-ship, funded by the HSE, analyzed the dispersion of COVID-19 under the umbrella of the National Core Studies (NCS).

Head over to the tabs in the navigation bar to find out more about me.

Thank you so much for visiting. I hope you have a great day!

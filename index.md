Hello! I'm Aniket and welcome to my personal website. 

Got my PhD from The Open University and a former Research Assistant with Imperial College London, where I completed my MSc in Advanced Nuclear Engineering with Distinction and won the William Penney prize for my thesis. 

My PhD focussed on combining high temperature steel performance with machine learning while my RA-ship, funded by the HSE, analyzed the dispersion of COVID-19 under the umbrella of the National Core Studies (NCS). Currently doing MLOps with [Pzeros]{https://pzeros.com/}, where I create and manage the computer vision pipelines and also the Looker (dashboard) side of things for visualisation.

Head over to the tabs in the navigation bar to find out more about me.

Thank you so much for visiting. I hope you have a great day!

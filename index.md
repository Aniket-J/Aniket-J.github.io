Hello! I'm Aniket J and welcome to my personal website. 

I'm a PhD Researcher with The Open University and a Visiting Researcher (and former Research Assistant) with Imperial College London. Currently, I'm looking for opportunities in machine learning.

My PhD focusses on combining high temperature steel performance with machine learning while my RA-ship, funded by the HSE, analysed the dispersion of COVID-19 under the umbrella of the National Core Study (NCS) project. 

Head over to the tabs in the navigation bar to find out more about me.

Thank you so much for visiting. I hope you have a great day!

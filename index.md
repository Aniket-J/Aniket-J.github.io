Hello! I'm Aniket and welcome to my personal website. 

Lead developer of RAPIDS (Rapid AI-Powered Image-to-Dynamic Simulations), which is a foundational generative AI package for surrogate modelling of fluid flows. This is the flagship software for one of Imperial College London's largest groups, AMCG (Applied Modelling & Computation Group). 

Prior experience includes Gen AI Research Engineer with the Royal College of Art (RCA) and the Young Vic Theatre. Very exciting role. Exploring and deploying tons of Gen AI tech, that includes LLMs, speech, and images. Very rewarding to see stuff in deployment, since we did the alpha run of the whole system in a controlled environment as well. Was also the Creative Technologist for the Five Shorts play at Young Vic, where we did something very similar but in WhatsApp.

Do have a PhD as well. My PhD focussed on combining high temperature steel performance with machine learning. Also did MLOps with [Pzeros](https://pzeros.com/), where I created and managed the computer vision pipelines (Docker mainly, deployed serverless (Cloud Run) and stateful (kubernetes)) and also the Looker (dashboard) side of things for visualisation.

Also a former Research Assistant with Imperial College London (where I completed my MSc in Advanced Nuclear Engineering with Distinction and won the William Penney prize for my thesis), funded by the HSE, analysed the dispersion of COVID-19 under the umbrella of the National Core Studies (NCS).

Thank you so much for visiting. I hope you have a great day!
